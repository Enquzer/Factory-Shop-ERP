# Shop Inventory Stock Display Issue Fix

## Problem Description

Shops were seeing products with high factory stock levels (e.g., 266 units) but still showing as "Out of Stock" when trying to order. This was confusing for shop users.

## Root Cause

The issue was a mismatch between what was displayed and what was actually available:

1. **Factory Stock**: The main product table showed high stock levels (266 units for "Enqu")
2. **Shop Inventory**: Each shop has its own inventory with limited stock (67 units for Megenagna, 0 for Mexico Shop)
3. **Display Logic**: The product detail dialog was showing factory stock levels to shops instead of their actual available inventory

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Product Detail Dialog
- Added clear indication that stock shown is shop-specific
- Added factory stock information for reference
- Improved visual distinction between in-stock and out-of-stock items

### 2. Enhanced Shop Inventory Page
- Improved stock status display with clearer labels
- Added "Low Stock" indicator for items nearing depletion
- Better visual feedback for out-of-stock items

### 3. Improved Order Creation Page
- Enhanced stock display with more descriptive badges
- Better handling of out-of-stock and low-stock scenarios
- Disabled quantity inputs for out-of-stock items

## Technical Details

The fix involved updating three key components:

1. **Product Detail Dialog** (`src/components/product-detail-dialog.tsx`):
   - Modified `getRealTimeAvailableStock` to properly use shop inventory
   - Added shop-specific stock information section
   - Enhanced visual feedback for stock status

2. **Shop Inventory Page** (`src/app/shop/(app)/inventory/_components/inventory-client.tsx`):
   - Improved badge variants for different stock levels
   - Added explicit "Low Stock" and "Out of Stock" labels

3. **Order Creation Page** (`src/app/shop/(app)/orders/create/page.tsx`):
   - Enhanced stock status badges with more descriptive text
   - Better handling of edge cases (out of stock, low stock)

## Verification

The fix was verified using a test script that checked the actual database values:

```
Product: Enqu (CL-TP-001)
Factory stock: 266 units (blue m)
Shop inventory:
  - Megenagna: 67 units
  - Mexico Shop: 0 units
```

Now when a shop user from Megenagna views the product, they see "67 in stock" instead of "266 in stock", which accurately reflects their available inventory.

## Benefits

1. **Clearer User Experience**: Shops now see their actual available inventory
2. **Reduced Confusion**: Factory stock levels are shown for reference but not used for ordering
3. **Better Inventory Management**: Shops can make informed decisions based on their actual stock
4. **Improved Order Accuracy**: Orders will not fail due to stock mismatches

## Future Considerations

1. **Inventory Replenishment Notifications**: Consider adding alerts when shop inventory is low
2. **Factory Stock Visibility**: Provide a way for shops to see factory stock levels for planning
3. **Automated Replenishment**: Implement automatic inventory replenishment workflows
