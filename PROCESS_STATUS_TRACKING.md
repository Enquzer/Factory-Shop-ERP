# Process Status Tracking Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the marketing orders list to display actual progress for each production stage (Cutting, Production, Packing, Delivery) with status indicators showing whether each stage is completed, partially completed, or pending.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Process Status Display
- Added a new "Process Status" column to the marketing orders table
- Displays real-time status for each production stage:
  - Cutting: Completed/Partial/Pending
  - Production: Completed/Partial/Pending
  - Packing: Completed/Partial/Pending
  - Delivery: Completed/Partial/Pending
- Shows percentage completion for partially completed stages

### 2. Backend API
- Created new API endpoint `/api/marketing-orders/process-status/[orderId]` to fetch process status summary
- Added `getProcessStatusSummary` client function to retrieve process status data
- Implemented database query to aggregate production data by process stage

### 3. Real-time Updates
- Fetches process status data for all orders on page load
- Displays color-coded status indicators:
  - Green: Completed stages
  - Yellow: Partially completed stages
  - Gray: Pending stages

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/marketing-orders/process-status/[orderId]/route.ts` - New API endpoint for process status
2. `src/lib/marketing-orders.ts` - Added `getProcessStatusSummary` function
3. `src/app/(app)/marketing-orders/page.tsx` - Updated table to display process status

## Key Improvements

### User Experience
- Clear visibility of production progress for each order
- Real-time status updates for all production stages
- Color-coded indicators for quick status recognition
- Percentage completion for partially completed stages

### Data Integrity
- Automated aggregation of production data by process stage
- Consistent data structure for process status reporting
- Proper error handling for missing or incomplete data

### Performance
- Efficient database queries with grouping and aggregation
- Parallel data fetching for multiple orders
- Client-side caching of process status data

## Usage Instructions

The process status is automatically displayed in the marketing orders table:
1. Navigate to the Marketing Orders page
2. View the "Process Status" column for each order
3. See real-time status for each production stage:
   - Cutting: Completed/Partial/Pending
   - Production: Completed/Partial/Pending
   - Packing: Completed/Partial/Pending
   - Delivery: Completed/Partial/Pending

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Endpoint
- **GET** `/api/marketing-orders/process-status/[orderId]`
- Returns aggregated production data grouped by process stage
- Includes total quantity, last update date, update count, and completion percentage

### Database Query
```sql
SELECT 
  processStage,
  SUM(quantity) as totalQuantity,
  MAX(date) as lastUpdateDate,
  COUNT(*) as updateCount
FROM daily_production_status 
WHERE orderId = ? AND processStage IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY processStage
ORDER BY lastUpdateDate DESC
```

### Status Determination Logic
- **Completed**: When total quantity >= order quantity
- **Partial**: When total quantity > 0 but < order quantity
- **Pending**: When total quantity = 0

### UI Components
- Added new table column for process status display
- Implemented helper functions for status text and color determination
- Used Lucide React icons for visual enhancement

This enhancement provides better visibility into production progress for each order while maintaining a clean and intuitive user interface.
