# Production Stage Tracking Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the daily production form to include a process stage dropdown for total quantity updates, allowing users to specify which production process stage they are updating (Cutting, Production, Packing, or Delivery).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Process Stage Dropdown
- Added a mandatory dropdown in the Total Production Update form
- Options include: Cutting, Production, Packing, Delivery
- Validation ensures a stage is selected before submission

### 2. Business Rule Enforcement
- Partial progress is allowed for all processes
- Sequential dependency is enforced - products cannot move to the next consecutive production process until at least some quantity has been recorded in the previous process
- Validation logic prevents invalid stage progression

### 3. Database Updates
- Added processStage column to daily_production_status table
- Modified updateDailyProductionStatus function to handle new field
- Updated API route to validate process stage for total updates

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/daily-production-form.tsx` - Added process stage dropdown and validation
2. `src/components/marketing-order-detail-dialog.tsx` - Pass order status to form
3. `src/app/api/marketing-orders/daily-status/route.ts` - Added validation for process stage
4. `src/lib/db.ts` - Added processStage column to database schema
5. `src/lib/marketing-orders.ts` - Updated DailyProductionStatus interface and update function

## Key Improvements

### User Experience
- Clear dropdown for selecting production process stage
- Mandatory field validation with helpful error messages
- Responsive layout that works on all screen sizes

### Data Integrity
- Process stage tracking for all total quantity updates
- Validation to ensure proper workflow progression
- Database schema updated to store process stage information

### System Architecture
