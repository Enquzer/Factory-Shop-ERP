   - Mitigation: Extensive training programs
   - Backup plan: Gradual rollout with pilot users

3. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Mitigation: Load testing before deployment
   - Backup plan: Performance optimization sprints

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Integration Failures**
   - Mitigation: API testing and validation
   - Backup plan: Manual processes as fallback

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
